Hi~ Welcome to my page!

I am currently doing undergraduate research intern in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hgjeoncv/" style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration:none;">**GIST Visual AI Lab**</a> under the supervision of Prof. Haegon Jeon.

My research interests lie on Inverse Rendering and Novel View Synthesis, with a current focus on Image Relighting. 💡

My goal is to address illumination problems that have yet to be solved in computer vision and graphics. 🤔

Here's my brief <a href="../assets/CV.pdf" class="link-in-list" style="color: #6A5ACD; text-decoration:none;"> **CV** </a>
